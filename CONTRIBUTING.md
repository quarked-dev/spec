# Contributing to the Quarked Specification

Contributing to the Quarked specification can be done in two ways:

* Creating suggestions
* Writing proposals

This document aims to assist you in how the Quarked ecosystem functions and how you can help.

## Suggestions

**Suggestions** are for discussing potential changes to the Quarked specification. They are ideas about proposals that could be written. Suggestions are submitted as [Issues](https://github.com/quarked-dev/spec/issues).

## Proposals

**Proposals** are written, formatted versions of Suggestions that outline exactly how the change could be implemented, why it should be made, and anything else that could help it become a part of Quarked. Proposals are submitted as [Pull Requests](https://github.com/quarked-dev/spec/issues).

### Writing a Proposal

To write a proposal, copy the template from `proposals/P-0.md` into your new file (see section below). Then, change the status to `Suggested`, and add your name/GitHub username to the authors list.

### Submitting a Proposal

To submit a proposal, you will fork and add a new file in the `proposals` directory. The file should be named `P-NUMBER.md`. The number is the next increment after the last one. You should also update the date in the Proposal to the current date.
